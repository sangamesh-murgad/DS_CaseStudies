"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",It's the best in this price range.,5.0,It's the best. I visited so many shops but never found such a comfortable chair for this price range. I set up all by myself in 15 minutes because of the clear instructions provided and of course all included tools.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown","Sturdy, Comfortable, Light Weight",5.0,"Ordered this for work from home after going through the numerous good reviews and boy! This chair is every bit worthy of all the good reviews. Reviewing it after using for a month.MaterialLeatherette cover over soft cushionSturdy plastic base and wheels (I wanted a steel one for more strength, but this is quite good to be honest)Wheels are very good quality and roll effortlesslyPadded arm rest for comfortDesignVery comfortable and spacious seating size wise (my husband with a bulky frame fits in comfortably on the chair) Arm rest is fixed and height cant be adjusted but it's fixed at a great comfortable heightCan carry heavy weight more than what is mentioned in the description, tested upto 114 kgs and the chair doesn't creak.It's a mid back chair, for me the back rest reaches a little below the shoulders when sitting upright. I am 5'9"" tall. The back is upright but not to an extent where it gets uncomfortable while splitting straight and working.Amazingly light weight. Have another chair from the brand featherlite purchased from a dealer in the same price range. This one hands down beats the featherlite chair.Super easy to assemble on your own, comes with instructions to assemble.All adjustments levers available for adjusting tilt and heightGo for it without any 2nd thought. Best product at this price range"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Absolute nonsense for this ridiculously high price chair,1.0,"1. There is no replacement or return possible if you are not satisfied with the product delivered2. Height of back support is smaller than what is is expected from the picture. Barely reaches your shoulder.3. Adjustable height is very small, than what you expect from such a high priced chair4. back support suspension is also very low.Bottom line: instead of risking your money on this non returnable nonsense, go to local market and buy after proper testing. I have seen far better product for far cheaper price than this. I regret very deeply for buying this product. I advice you not to repeat the mistake I did and regret."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Great Value for Money,5.0,"I use this chair for at-least 8-9 hours a day & Its Great Value for Money, but its not extremely comfortable for you money what you pay it is undervalued i most say.Overall for this price it is a great product & i am very much satisfied with it.I had done lot of research before buying this chair & now i'm totally satisfied with it. Just go for it.....Thank you amazon for such a great product."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown","Uncomfortable, thin cushion",1.0,Writting this review after 3 days of use.This chair lack the most import part which is comfort. A very thin layer of cushion that doesn't provide enough support. One can feel the metal base when sitting for just couple of hours. Not recommended at all.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Best quality. frabric used is soft artificial leather,5.0,Best quality. frabric used is soft artificial leather . feel is good. Now using since 1 year.They called for assembling. But I easily assembled with the help of guide provided.Best product . just go for it
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Faux leather chairs are the worst for daily WFH use,2.0,"I came back to write a review 1 year after the purchase and realised the price has gone up by at least 2k. If you’re looking to buy an office chair for your WFH setup, please don’t go for this. A basic mesh type chair would suffice. It might look more comfortable and even feel so for the first few days but after that you will start feeling the cushions start giving up and start flattening. I’m getting very bad lower back pain because it literally squeezes down to the metallic base of it. Moreover, the leather material is very bad in breathability and unless you have an AC in your room, don’t go for it. I remember having this last summer and every time I get up I used to leave sweat stains on the handle and seat and it damaged the faux leather. Giving it a 2 star rating since the time I bought it, it was okay for the price but now it’s nowhere near worth it."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good chair and it Reclines..,4.0,Very broad seat hence hand rest is little uncomfortable to use while working on computer. This chair reclines. Some people have complained that it doesn't tilt backwards but that is assembling problem. Just see if the round twist knob beneath the chair seat is in front-side or not. Need to put that at front side as shown in the product pictures here.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Not very satisfied,3.0,"I'm not satisfied with the chair, but don't want to return it since it's not the right time to place return orders. Hence I would be keeping it.A few things I didn't like about the chair are:The back isn't completely straight and it pushes behind a bit when you place your back against it, not quite sturdy.Overall, the chair looks smallThe material of the chair doesn't look quite sturdy."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Perfect chair for guests in the office,5.0,"I got this as a guest chair for a small office room and everyone always talks about how comfortable it is and how posh it looks. Being a Amazon brand, the pricing is just right and the quality is simply awesome. The rexin is not breaking up at this point, hopefully will last a long long time.It took about 30 minutes to assemble the chair myself, I did not use the amazon offer for free assembling. Its very simple and you dont need any additional tools, everything you need is already provided in the box."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Waste of money for this product. Purchased during lockdown because of lack of options,1.0,"This is not a good product neither value for money.By adding few amount, you can get a very good option in Nilkamal. But, I have bought it during Lockdown so didn't get much options as well as not applicable for return too.Quality is not good. It will not last more. Also, damaged from one place.I am feeling guilty after buying this product but I don't have much option during lockdown situation and another product was not deliverable.Last but not least, It is made is China product. So, it will not be durable. Although, it has not mentioned here that made in China."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good product within a good offer price!,5.0,"The product looks exactly what is displayed. Have to assemble on your own as the product comes in knock down condition. Quite easy if you follow their given instruction manual inside the box. Product looks good and durable. Comfort wise very good, if you do not miss the high back chair you were using before. I am 6.1"" and bit heavy - but it fits me right. So enough seat space and height of back rest is good though it's mid back. Overall good purchase. Hopefully it will work durable, that I am giving it a time of minimum 2 years after good use and then only I will take it worthy in the sense of durability. Can go for it without doubt!"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good Looking and comfortable seating pros and cons list,5.0,"This is one of the good purchases of mine. I got similar one from my Amazon de account for Belgium location and that was really expensive than this chair. Also, this chair is good for Students and Desktop setup learners.Pros:1. Well it's really simple and comfortable2. Elegant look.3. Easy to assemble ( I got mine assembled myself, as the VECARE guys didn't show up at my home).4. The chair is little bit Cozy and not really cozy.5. Would recommend this chair to everyone who are in budget like me. (yeah, I do have budget plans when I purchase any item for me).Cons:1. One thing I don't like about this Chair is the wheels are super fast with a slight push. I didn't like it personally.2. The package was little damaged outside but it didn't break the inner chair parts.3. The chair doesn't have a head rest. I know, I wantedly purchased this knowing there is no head rest. But still it might be helpful for someone who wants it. I don't want it though ;)"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",My 3 month long search stopped at this chair,5.0,"I have developed pain in lower back and cervical both in last 1 year. After work from home , I was trying to find a home chairnwhich is as comfortable as I had one in my office. I spent 3 months on internet buy couldnot find anything anywhere. Atlast I settled down for this chair looking at the good reviews. I have found thiss chair very satisfactory.POSITIVE:(1)It is the chair for me. Could not find anything close to it.(2)It provides superb support to lower back. I could feel the difference as earlier I was sitting on straight back dining chair.(3) it's very quick to assemble. Excellent quality. Fabric is smooth ( honestly I never cared for fabric as I am 6 ft tall and was very suspicious to get the perferct chair for my back problem )NEGATIVE(1) As the name suggests it only supports mid back. In order to relieve your neck you need to raise the height of your laptop screen/workstation screen by placing them on support/box etc."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",It's a chair.,5.0,"It's good to sit on. Comfortable. I sit at my desk a lot and this new chair is very comfortable, but only if you set the height and tilt properly. Make sure it fits with your computer desk if you have one.You should definitely not take the free assembly service. That guy will beg you for a tip incessantly. You might as well make it yourself if you have the time and the ability.I wish it was a little less expensive. But you get what you pay for. I'm not sure I'd trust any other company to sell me a computer chair on Amazon other than Amazon it self."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",This chair was too good and beyond my expectation and that too at a ...,5.0,"This chair was too good and beyond my expectation and that too at a very reasonable price. I must thank Amazon for this.  Nicely packed and delivered within 24 hours. It was easy installing the product and I did it myself going through the manual.  I am pretty sure that at this price this chair is nowhere available online.  Without any second thought, guys go for this product and you will surely won't regret it."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Made in China !!!,3.0,1. Delivery was timely and in good packing and condition. No defects.2. This is a China product which I missed to note before ordering. Otherwise I would not not ordered it.3. Average office chair. Looks good. Comfortable to sit and rest hands.3. Back rest is not flexible. You can't adjust it's angle.4. Traps a lot of body heat. Back and seat feels very warm after sitting for a few minutes. I would recommend to buy a chair with mesh back.5. I assembled it myself. Took about 30 mins. Assembly service is also available at no extra cost.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Pneumatic seat goes down while sitting. Quality Issue !!!,1.0,It is disappointing due to this problem of seat going down while you are busy working. There is some leakage of the pneumatic cylinder and due to which the chair seat goes slowly down (within 10 sec). I get up and raise the seat again to working level by operating the lever. This is annoying and I have stopped using the chair. I won't recommend such a chair to anyone.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Sitting on the chair is a pain in the ...,2.0,"The chair looks good and nice. Sturdy design too. However, if one sits on the chair for a long time, then you feel the pain. The cushion is not good at all. I have use a small pillow on the cushion so that atleast the pain becomes less. I bought the chair reading at the reviews and something has changed suddenly in the way the chair is manufactured. I wont recommend this chair if you have to sit for long hours."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Amazing amazon,1.0,"Amazon installation team local guys are extremely professional, they will make you laugh with their expertise, I was so over whelmed that I decided to return the chair and buy again probably so they can make me spend my day again talking to them on phones and writing emails. 100% recommended, buy and choose installation day when u are bored."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Bad buy,1.0,The seat of the chair isn't comfortable enough; you can feel the base through the cushion. The fabric used is sub-standard. It started to wear off within 2 months of use and is now torn at several places.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",A little overpriced for the features it has. Good for short sittings.,3.0,"Writing this keeping the price in mind- Have been using this chair since 4-5 days now. It makes some noise while bending or moving (not able to figure out where is it coming from). Also, if you want to bend back, you need to apply lots of pressure from your feet to do so. Good for short span of sitting but would not recommend for long runs."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",An office chair at reasonable price,4.0,"The AmazonBasics chair is a decent purchase considering the price point. Very easy to assemble. Took just around 30 minutes. Comfortable for short durations since the lower back support is not great. Also, there are no wheel locks which makes the chair less suitable for tiled / granite floors and in turn for home use. I bought it for my home and always need to be conscious of the potential movement whenever I try to stretch!! At least three out of the 5 wheels could have been given simple wheel locks (as in the low priced particle board computer tables).Overall a good furniture and if added with little lower back support and wheel locks, it would be a great furniture."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Ok for occasional use in home,3.0,"I received pretty late due to COVID situation and assembly guy never turned up. After waiting for some time I did the chair assembly my self, it was simple and well explained.Once started using I found its good in normal seating and ergonomic.. but within three weeks I felt not good, cushion is gone and I can feel bottom plank.It’s good for short seating but not so for day long work.I can feel less support on bottom and back now after using for two months. Finally it’s pure Chinese product. Looks good, but durability with quality is not expected from it.If get it in less cost it’s ok for short seatings, I got it at high price so it’s not worth that money. Do not compare or expect like office chairs ."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Not recommended for sitting for long duration,1.0,Very uncomfortable for sitting long duration. No back support. After a day or two the seating area feels like sitting on a hard surface which will create problem in long run. Not a good product from Amazon. Don't buy to work from home or study from home.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Size of chair is not matching as per description. Money return has issue even after sometime 14 days,1.0,"Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   Description is not matching what the actual chair delivered. Chair was picked up without dismantling.Even after initiating a return, Money is not credited even after 14 days."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Very nice and ergonomic!!,4.0,"Bought this for my son's study table. Amazon delivered this item really fast. Easy assembly, takes around 30 mins reading the instruction booklet supplied with the chair. Nice ergonomic look and comfortable to sit. Only drawback is it does not tilt much, otherwise a nice chair."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Easy to built,5.0,Easy to built. Nice leatherette quality. Comfortable. The wheel are working smoothly. Back rest can be change but not the arm rest part.I find the Amazon basics of great quality and so far i was not disappointed.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Super comfy,5.0,"Best dealSuper comfy, smooth wheels, easy to assemble, wide body and good cushion.Cons, it's not reclining chair so it's a body reclining and it's alright.You have very good wide base you can adjust and be comfortable. You can stretch your body without an issue. Super great chair"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Ok product not value for money,3.0,"My wife feels  comfortable with the product but i face issue with base support, there is some resistance at the base. Also in terms of back support i felt back pain after using it for one week. Over all if u can buy seat comforter with this its good to go"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Decent economical leather chair.,4.0,"Decent chair. Comfortable. Since it is leather can get a bit warm if the room is not properly ventilated or air conditioned.Although the instructions are very easy to follow I spent close to 45 mins or so to assemble and still could not get one the arms to fit in correctly. When the technician arrived he used bit oil and was able to correctly screw one of the arms.At this price range there are not many options available that give you value for the money spent.And of course the chair is made in China, so if you have stopped buying Chinese products, stay away from this one."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown","Chair is good quality , but assembly provider is bad",2.0,"The chair is of good quality and seems reasonably ergonomic. The cushioning is also of good quality.Only downside is that the free provided assembly is unreliable and the provider doesn't show up on the selected time slot.Buy only if you are willing to assemble it yourself and spend 45 minutes on that.In my case the provider simply lied that he was unable to contact me , when i asked the number he called i was given a wrong number. After this numerous attempts to call amazon service to get it assembled at least the next day also failed. The provider finally called me the next day asking me that if my chair got assembled , even when clearly he knew it did not. Then he suggested me for next day ( but i was unavailable for 2 days) , by now the product had been sitting unassembled for 5 days .1 YEAR UPDATE - Chair back padding became very flat and needs extra pillow for lumbar support. Also the back is no longer at 90 degree with the base and is like 105 degrees now which is not good ergonomically. All parts of chair are intact though nothing broken."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",WROST PRODUCT,1.0,"Please don't buy this productConcerns:Not comfortable for sitting, you will get back and neck pains.Height Adjustment Issues.The seat Cushion is not good, It's really hard after 1-2 weeks of usage.It's not worth for money.Unfortunately, I brought it for good ratings (4 Star and Amazon Product)Finally, the Customer Care number won't be connected."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Spend some extra money but get a better chair,1.0,It's hard to assemble on your own and no communication on whether or not someone will be sent for installation. The cushioning is bare minimum and it's not comfortable for long duration sitting. I am using a separate pillow as a cushion for the chair. The leather also feels like a cheap material.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Moderate Rolling chair for home,4.0,Packing was good. Easy to assemble. Solid wheels and rolling mechanism. Back support is good. Thigh support is weak and over the day you will feel not comfortable sitting for long hours.My suggestion - If you are wanting to go for a good chair better invest some more and go for some good ergonomic chairs ard 10K.. if you are looking for budget constrains then this chair is okaish and good enuf.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good And comfortable chair.,5.0,"Very good chair. Someone recommend me to purchase the Amazon basics product. I was worried since Solimo was bad experience with Amazon but this product is fine...till now after 3 days I feel comfortable, but price should be little more optimised. Let see how it goes after using longer time."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",very good chair in every aspects in very econimical price!!!,5.0,"This chair is very good. Before this chair, I was using the executive chair but after breaking that by my child, I searched a lot of products and found this product. In this price range, this is the best product in comfort and durability...I have purchased this during WFH and I am totally satisfied with this product and delivery service that delivered me this in time!"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Best chair for Low budget,5.0,"The product is perfect. For last 6 years I sat on a hard stool while working on my PC. After buying this chair, it felt so good. In this price, Amazon offers a perfect chair that provides comfort and also helps me to work for hours without backpain. Loving this chair."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown","never buy this chair,price very high website description",1.0,"setting side spunch matarialvery poor,wheel chair cover zip very poorprice very high website description,never buy this chairsuppose, you are buy chair, u don't like chair,return policy very trouble"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good,4.0,"Good at this price.i bought it on prime day deal,at ?4,899.This will be good for study,sliders working great,it’s so soft and comfortable,no little damage is there,assambly service is good too.Only problem was there was delay of delivery after it arrived in my city,but that’s negligible point after such good product.I will update this review after 1 month of usage."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Half support only for back rest,2.0,The product was delivered by Amazon on 2nd-Jan-2021. Please take note that the back rest is half size hence it is called mid back. (wish it would have been clearly specified). The shoulder support is very poor. The 15.1" length specified is full length than from arm rest which is also deceiving. The chair won't be of great use for long hours as your shoulder will be half supported. It is probably better for kids. Disappointing as Amazon didn't made that very clear on website nor they accepted the argument to return for different model.Secondly it is not reclining but a tilt chair.  Surprised to see high ratings on the chair too.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Seat is not Symantric .one side is up and another side is down,1.0,"This is a made in China Product.Please make the information available to customer like county of Origin.AM not interested in any Chinese product , so as many Amazon customer .So request to amazon and all Indian seller to stop selling china product in IndiaSeat is not Symantric .one side is up and another side is down"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Review after 2 and half years.,3.0,"Writing this review after 2 and half years. In the first 2 years chair was sparingly used.in the last 5 months the chair has been used for 10-11 hours daily due to work from home conditions arising from COVID situation.The rexin in the seat started peeling off ,exposing the foam underneath.The seating portion became very hard  with the steel portion causing a lot of discomfort and pain while sitting.Not worth investing 5k in this product"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good,4.0,Its mentioned as "mid-back" so no complains for not providing full back support.I am doubtful with the cusion. Its thin. Not sure how long it is going to last.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good chair for work from home,3.0,"Seat and back rest cushions must be thicker to give more comfort. Except this, the product is easy to assemble and good looking.This product is nice for working from home also.For back support, one can use lumber support also.Back rest is fixed, at the time of tilting, seat and back tilts altogether, it is not reclining-back type."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",A word for my long-limbed-homies...,4.0,"Fairly decent. I wouldn't say it is fantastic, but it does the job. I'm 5'4"" and I felt that I would have preferred the seat to reach a little further than just my mid thigh. But it probably works better for others with different body types. I feel tall folks might have trouble.Pros:1. Soft leather seating2. Arm rest height is decent3. Easy to assemble4. Soft on my back!Cons:1. The recline could be better2. Could have added more height variation, but that's just my opinion."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Without an adjustable backrest this is an uncomfortable chair,2.0,"The back rest is stiff, making it uncomfortable. The only thing you can adjust in this chair is the height. The wheels are very unstable, you have to make an effort to keep it in a stationary position - this is a design flaw.Finally, because of all these, its not worth the money."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Not worth,1.0,After use of six monthsPros1.easy to assemble2. Seat cover material is good.Cons1. No cushioning. You will feel seat base after a few minutes2. Seat back not designed as per required norms. No comfort at all.3. No back and fro rocking movement.4. Chair not worth more than 2000
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Overall Good Chair,4.0,Overall Good Chair except few observationsGood things :1. Very light weight2. Easy to move and spin aroundBad:1. Doesn't have great cushioning. If you looking for extreme comfort for long hours then better go for another one.2. May not suit very tall people as the back support is short.3. Very sensitive top layer prone to wear and tear so better have to handle carefully not to bump onto other things. If you looking for very durable chair then better but more expensive one.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Sturdy But Bad Cushioning,2.0,"The cushion on both the backrest and the seat is very thin. It is thin to the point of being impractical for an office chair. One has to get an extra pair of cushions to make the chair usable. The mechanicals seem sturdy. Hopefully, it will last."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Tough to assemble/poor assembly support,1.0,Bad cushion. Extremely uncomfortableAssembly was initially promised but then converted to DIY.

"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Little difficult to Assemble. Good comfort,4.0,"The Chair was difficult to assemble. Some components are easy, but the back and seat are very difficult. I had to hire a carpenter to do that. Thats an additional 500 Rs.Usage experience is very good"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Good one but not too good,3.0,"my first order after lockdown and delivery was delayed (which is ok), easy to Assemble with provided DIY tool.Ergonomic and back drop is seat cushion it isn't good at all at this price, could have been more better.Apart from cushion everything is good and not a fancy chair."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Decent chair,3.0,"The quality isn't great, not suitable if you are going sit for straight 4hrs or more. Comfort wise it is decent.I got it for 5.2k, in this price range its worth but anything more than 5.5k for this not worth it"
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Four Stars,3.0,"*edit after 1 year.The hinge supporting the height adjustment is misbehaving, you can be sunk in slowly while sitting which is very annoying to set it again and again. Hope amazon has any fix for this.The height could have been more for 5-11, 6 feet people"

"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Best in the market. Comfy.,5.0,I would recommend this chair for people who need to work for continuous hours. This chair is comfortable and comes with a premium look. The build quality in this price range is a win. It does reclines back(the whole seat though).

"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Very comfortable chair,5.0,I finally got this chair after waiting for lots of time. This chair is beautiful and support comfortable. Very solid and stronge. Price also was gud as got a discount in same season.
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Dont go for it. Cheap quality product. Cant return as per policy,1.0,"This is definitely not an acceptable quality from Amazon brand. Chair cushion material is very sensitive and stitches made to that matErial are ready to cut loose after few days. A Lesson, not to choose by brand. Sad part is I cant return the product like some mistakes cant be corrected.  Stay away. Save your money."
"AmazonBasics Faux Leather Mid-Back Office Chair, Brown",Not recommended,2.0,"This chair will not last long at all.
